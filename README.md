Hello! Here I'm going to answer some questions that some ppl (or nobody?) may ask:
# How do I know if a file was made by you?
If it's not in the "notmine" directory, that means it was made by me!
# Do you use AI for anything?
While I may not be against AI, I don't see how I could use it for anything (and also I like to do stuff by myself rather than just lazily ask an AI to do stuff for me, it just feels unrewarding and effortless, and it also affects my learning process)
